                    <p>Around 6:30 am on Saturday, 7th of October 2023, the Hamas terrorists launched an attack on Israel . Hundreds of terrorists infiltrated to Israeli settlements. During the infiltration into Israel, the terrorists arrived at Ofakim around 6:45 in the morning.<br><br>Rachel and her husband were surrounded in thrir home by the five armed Hamas terrorists. The terrorists had many weapons , including grenades, AK-47 assault rifles, and a Lao missile.</p>

                    <p>“I started to talk to them. Have you had something to drink? Would you like tea or coffee?”</p>

                    <p>Undeterred by the ever-present danger, Edri began to talk with her captors, asking them where they were from and trying to dissuade them from their planned murder. As the afternoon wore on, Edri offered to bandage the injured hand of one of the terrorists, and, seeking to soothe him, brought him water as well as some canned pineapple. “You look pallid, “she told him. Take something to eat; you will feel better.” Meanwhile, an elite police force had arrived outside their house, accompanied by her police officer son, who had gotten word of the attack and rushed to his parents' house. An officer attempted to negotiate with the terrorists to get Rachel released to no avail.<br><br>Just in the early morning of the next day, the rescue team, aided by a drone and the outline of the house that their son had drawn, burst into the home through the roof with a special rescue dog, killing all four terrorists. The Edris escaped unscathed. </p>

                <ul> Ingredients
                    <li>2 eggs</li>
                    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                    <li>½ cup oil</li>
                    <li>2 cups, plus 2 Tbsp. flour</li>
                    <li>½ tsp. baking soda</li>
                    <li>¾ cup chocolate chips</li>
                </ul>

                <ol> Directions
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
                    <li>Beat the eggs and sugar together.</li>
                    <li>Add the rest of the ingredients and mix until a sticky dough is formed.</li>
                    <li>Make balls the size of a ping-pong ball, and place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper [I used a 1 tbsp measuring spoon to scoop the cookies because the batter was quite sticky.]</li>
                    <li>Bake for about 14 minutes.</li>
                    <li>The cookies will come out of the oven soft, but will firm up as they cool.</li>
                </ol>
